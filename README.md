- Drag blocks off the conveyor belt and onto your structure. Get your center of mass as low as you can with 100 blocks.
- Blocks with matching edges stick to each other.
- Scaffolding is lighter than Plates and affects your center of mass less.
- Blocks wear out and break over time. You can damage scaffolding by clicking on it.
- Free-floating blocks will fall off your structure, but you can catch them with blocks below...
- You can embed new anchor points in the wall, but only if you already have a block adjacent for it to match with.
- If you build a whole line of blocks across the chasm, they will wear out much slower.

Try and beat my high score of 57!
