# Excavation Site Alpha

Drag blocks off the conveyor belt with your mouse and match up the connectors. Rotate them with the scroll wheel.
Get your center of mass as deep as possible.

Blocks get damaged over time from the stress. If you have a line of blocks all the way across the chasm,
they get damaged much less. If a cluster of blocks isn't attached to an anchor it will fall.

You might occasionally get a new anchor point to embed in the wall of the chasm.
You can only place it right below another anchor or connect it to a block already by the wall.

Click on scaffolding blocks to damage them. (Why? You'll see.)
